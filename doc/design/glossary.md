"Archive" - The front-facing location for currently symlinked files, sorted into user-name directories.
"Vault" - The back-facing location, where files from the Archive are compressed and stored.
"db" - anything else that has to do with sqlite, for keeping track of the above two
"bundle" - files that are tarballed or compressed (or both) that contains files from an Archive, located in the Vault
